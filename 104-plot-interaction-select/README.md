This app demonstrates two ways of selecting points.
and prints out the points selected

The first way is to use `nearPoints()` with the click input object.
This can be a bit finicky, it really needs to be on the dot, for it to register

The second way is to use `brushedPoints()` with the brush input object. Alot
more useful

However you can only do one selection.
